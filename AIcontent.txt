Response 1 (Original problematic line (likely):
# Gameboard.addToken(game1, player, row)
# Should be called on the instance 'game1'

Corrected line in main.py:
# Get the input and store it as 'col_input' for clarity
        col_input = input(f"player {player}, enter column to put token (1-7): ")

        # Call the method on the instance 'game1'
        game1.addToken(player, col_input)
Note: this was not correct but made me realise i hadn't converted the response to a number after getting user input
Prompt 2 (what is the best way to do a GUI in python?)
Response 2 (Choosing the "best" way to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Python depends heavily on your project's requirements, your personal familiarity with the frameworks, and the desired look and feel of the application.

Here is a breakdown of the most popular and recommended Python GUI toolkits:

🏆 Top Python GUI Frameworks

Framework	Pre-installed	Recommended For	Key Features
Tkinter	Yes (Standard Library)	Simple, small applications; Cross-platform compatibility; Beginners.	Easiest to start with; Low overhead; Good documentation.
Qt (PyQt/PySide)	No	Complex, professional-grade applications; Desktop applications; Data visualization tools.	Excellent widget library; Mature, battle-tested; Uses an intuitive design tool (Qt Designer).
Kivy	No	Multi-touch applications; Cross-platform including mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop.	Highly customizable graphics; Uses a KV language for layout separation; Open-source.
wxPython	No	Native look-and-feel applications; Applications needing tight integration with the host OS.	Wraps the native operating system's GUI libraries, offering a truly native feel.

🛠️ Framework Deep Dive

1. Tkinter: The Default Choice

Tkinter is generally the best starting point because it is included with standard Python installations, meaning no extra installation is required.

    Pros: It's fast for simple UIs, requires no dependencies, and is cross-platform.

    Cons: The default widgets can look a bit dated compared to modern applications, though themed extensions (like ttk) help.

When to use it: When you need a quick utility or a simple application where a modern aesthetic isn't the main concern.

2. PyQt / PySide (The Qt Framework)

Qt is arguably the most powerful and feature-rich option for professional desktop applications.

    PyQt and PySide (the official Qt Python binding) are very similar. PySide is generally preferred now because it uses the more permissive LGPL license, making it better for commercial projects.

    Pros: Industry-standard quality, vast array of widgets, and the Qt Designer tool lets you visually drag-and-drop your UI instead of writing all the layout code.

    Cons: Larger size, steeper learning curve than Tkinter.

When to use it: For enterprise software, large data science dashboards, or any application where a highly polished, feature-rich interface is required.

3. Kivy: The Mobile-First Option

Kivy is unique as it is primarily designed for rapid development of multi-touch applications.

    Pros: Runs on almost anything (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS), excellent for custom, game-like, or touch-based UIs.

    Cons: Does not use native widgets, so the look is non-native and uniform across all platforms.

When to use it: When your application needs to be deployed on mobile devices or requires extensive custom graphics and multi-touch support.

💡 Recommendation for Beginners

Start with Tkinter. Since it is pre-installed, you can begin immediately. It will teach you the fundamental concepts of GUI programming, such as widgets, event handling, and layout managers.

Once you outgrow Tkinter or need a more professional look, move on to PySide6 (Qt). It offers the best balance of power, community support, and professional-grade tools.
