response(Original problematic line (likely):
# Gameboard.addToken(game1, player, row)
# Should be called on the instance 'game1'

Corrected line in main.py:
# Get the input and store it as 'col_input' for clarity
        col_input = input(f"player {player}, enter column to put token (1-7): ")

        # Call the method on the instance 'game1'
        game1.addToken(player, col_input)
Note: this was not correct but made me realise i hadn't converted the response to a number after getting user input
